Tun aim of the Publishers, in this edition os Horace,
has been to meet the growing demand for Annotations
on the Classica, ns Enoursn. In the general esti-
mato, the advantage of the scholar stands before

obvious, in the work os instruction, be of utility

no condition to reap the benefit of them3 and boys,
in particular, are too easily repulsed by difficulties,
to force their way through so formidable an obstruc-

ever make the attempt. There will still be teachers
to deprecate this innovation upon established prac-
tice3 but to advance to the unknown through the

known is the dictate of common sense—as applicable
